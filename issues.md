Now I have a comprehensive view of the entire Laxis game structure. You're absolutely right - there are significant systemic structural issues beyond just the drag-drop. Let me identify the major architectural problems:

## ðŸš¨ **MAJOR SYSTEMIC STRUCTURAL ISSUES**

### **1. BROKEN QUEST DISTRIBUTION LOGIC**
**Problem:** [`LaxisEngine.getCardsForQuest()`](packages/laxis_engine/lib/src/laxis_engine.dart:51) only returns cards that are IN the solution
- **Issue:** This makes the game trivial - players only see correct cards
- **Expected:** Should provide additional distractor cards to create challenge
- **Evidence:** Line 52-54 filters to `quest.solution.contains(c.id)` only

### **2. INCOMPLETE CONJUGATION SYSTEM**
**Problem:** [`ConjugationWidget`](packages/laxis_ui/lib/conjugation_widget.dart:13) is completely non-functional
- **Issue:** Buttons have no logic, no state management, no integration with game
- **Impact:** Core PRD requirement "Interactive Conjugation Module" is broken
- **Evidence:** All buttons have empty `onPressed: () {}` callbacks

### **3. HARDCODED GERMAN DEPENDENCIES IN UI LAYER**
**Problem:** [`CardWidget`](packages/laxis_ui/lib/card_widget.dart:29) contains hardcoded German verb forms
- **Violation:** UI layer should be language-agnostic per architecture
- **Issue:** `const toBeForms = {'bin', 'bist', 'ist', 'sind', 'seid'};` in UI
- **Impact:** Breaks modularity - can't add other languages

### **4. MISSING REPETITION ALGORITHM**
**Problem:** [`LaxisEngine`](packages/laxis_engine/lib/src/laxis_engine.dart:60) has placeholder repetition logic
- **Issue:** 20% random chance is not a learning algorithm
- **PRD Requirement:** "Repetition Algorithm (v1) that re-injects concepts"
- **Current:** Just adds random previously learned cards

### **5. BROKEN QUEST PROGRESSION**
**Problem:** [`GameScreen`](packages/laxis_ui/lib/game_screen.dart:40) has no quest ordering logic
- **Issue:** `getNextQuest()` returns first incomplete quest, ignoring dependencies
- **Missing:** No prerequisite system, difficulty progression, or unlocking
- **Impact:** Students can jump to advanced concepts without foundations

### **6. NO ERROR BOUNDARY OR STATE RECOVERY**
**Problem:** Multiple crash points with no graceful degradation
- **Issues:** 
  - Asset loading failures crash entire app
  - Missing card IDs cause runtime exceptions
  - No offline mode despite PRD requirement NFR8

### **7. INCONSISTENT DATA MODELS**
**Problem:** Mismatch between JSON structure and code expectations
- **JSON has:** `title`, `difficulty`, `points`, `type`, `translation` fields
- **Code uses:** Only `id`, `prompt`, `solution`, `conceptIds`
- **Impact:** Rich content is ignored, poor user experience

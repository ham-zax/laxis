### **Requirements**

#### **Functional**
1.  FR1: The platform shall have functional builds for Web, iOS, and Android.
2.  FR2: The Laxis Engine shall include a Quest System, Card System, Sentence-Building Mat, Interactive Conjugation Module, and Instant Feedback System.
3.  FR3: The Laxis Engine shall include a Repetition Algorithm (v1) that re-injects concepts into future puzzles.
4.  FR4: The German Language Module shall have an onboarding screen to select between "A1: Foundations" and "A2: Advancement" tracks.
5.  FR5: The German Language Module shall include a complete, self-contained module for the A1 curriculum.
6.  FR6: The German Language Module shall include a complete, self-contained module for the A2 curriculum.
7.  FR7: The platform shall provide separate progress tracking for the A1 and A2 tracks.
8.  FR8: The platform shall include a unified card collection/dictionary.

#### **Non-Functional Requirements (Core Architectural Mandates)**
1.  **NFR1: True Modularity:** The architecture MUST be language-agnostic. The core Laxis Engine must have no hardcoded dependencies on any specific language's grammar or content.
2.  **NFR2: Strict Separation:** The Language Module (content, rules) and the Laxis Engine (gameplay logic, UI) must be strictly separated. It should be possible to add a new language by creating a new content module without changing the engine's code.

#### **Non-Functional Requirements**

*   **Performance:**
    *   NFR3: The application should launch in under 3 seconds on a modern smartphone.
    *   NFR4: Puzzle interactions (card dragging, feedback) should be instant (<100ms).
    *   NFR5: The application should consume a reasonable amount of battery life.
*   **Security:**
    *   NFR6: All user data must be stored securely.
    *   NFR7: The application will not have any server-side components for the MVP, reducing the attack surface.
*   **Reliability:**
    *   NFR8: The application should function correctly offline.
    *   NFR9: The application should gracefully handle unexpected errors and not crash.

#### **Cross-Functional Requirements**

*   **Data:**
    *   CFR1: All user progress will be stored locally on the device.
    *   CFR2: The application will be designed to allow for future synchronization of progress across devices.
*   **Integrations:**
    *   CFR3: There are no external integrations for the MVP.
*   **Operations:**
    *   CFR4: The application will be deployed to the Apple App Store, Google Play Store, and as a web application.

### **Out of Scope for MVP**

*   **Additional Language Modules:** All other languages (e.g., Spanish, French) are out of scope.
*   **Advanced Modes:** The more complex "Drill Mode" and "Review Mode" are out of scope.
*   **Dynamic Placement Test, Audio Features, Monetization, Social Features.**

### **User Interface Design Goals**

*   **Overall UX Vision:** The experience must feel like an intellectual puzzle game, not a textbook. It should be encouraging, rewarding the "Aha!" moment of solving a grammatical puzzle. The design must minimize cognitive load, allowing the user to focus on the challenge at hand.
*   **Key Interaction Paradigms:** The primary interaction will be a drag-and-drop card-based system for sentence construction. Instant feedback will be provided on the correctness of the constructed sentences.
*   **Core Screens and Views:**
    *   Onboarding/Level Selection Screen
    *   Quest/Puzzle Screen (with card-based sentence building)
    *   Progress Tracking Screen
    *   Unified Card Collection/Dictionary Screen
*   **Accessibility:** WCAG AA.
*   **Branding:** The Laxis brand should be present. The visual design should be modern and engaging.
*   **Target Device and Platforms:** Web Responsive, iOS, and Android.

### **Technical Assumptions**

*   **Repository Structure:** Monorepo
*   **Service Architecture:** Modular Monolith. The MVP will be a single deployable service, but it will be internally structured with strict modular boundaries (e.g., an independent "Curriculum Module" and "Progress Module"). This is a stepping stone toward a future microservices architecture and is non-negotiable for ensuring long-term scalability.
*   **Testing Requirements:** Unit + Integration
*   **Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests:**
    *   **Language:** Dart
    *   **Framework:** Flutter
    *   **Deployment Targets:** Web, iOS, and Android

### **Epic List**

*   **Epic 1: Foundation & Core Engine:** Establish the project foundation and the core Laxis Engine, including the quest system, card system, sentence-building mat, interactive conjugation module, and instant feedback system.
    *   **User Value Narrative:** This epic delivers the core interactive "game board" for Laxis. By the end, we will have a functional, tactile puzzle experience that feels engaging, even with placeholder content.

    *   **User Value Narrative:** This epic breathes life into the Laxis engine with our first complete learning module. For the first time, a user can have a complete, valuable learning experience from start to finish for the A1 level.
*   **Epic 3: German Language Module (A2) & Progression:** Implement the A2 German language module, the progression system between A1 and A2, and the unified card collection/dictionary.
    *   **User Value Narrative:** This epic completes our MVP promise by adding the advanced beginner content and the meta-features that provide long-term value, like reviewing learned concepts in the dictionary.

### **Epic 1: Foundation & Core Engine**

**Goal:** Establish the project foundation and the core Laxis Engine, including the quest system, card system, sentence-building mat, interactive conjugation module, and instant feedback system.

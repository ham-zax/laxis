# PR: Laxis — PRD alignment + Learn Hub, SRS, Deck & Sentence Builder (YOLO pass)

Summary
- Aligned codebase with updated PRD (Learn > Apply > Master flow) by adding Learn Hub entry, global SRS review queue, deck-based Sentence Builder, and SRS wiring.
- Implemented quick, highest-value changes in a single YOLO pass to enable end-to-end play flows from app home to learning micro-games.

Files changed / added
- Updated SRS + deck wiring
  - [`packages/core/lib/src/deck_service.dart`](packages/core/lib/src/deck_service.dart:1) — Deck save now registers cards with SRS (SrsService.ensureCardExists).
  - [`packages/core/lib/src/deck.dart`](packages/core/lib/src/deck.dart:1) — Deck model (existing reference).
  - [`packages/core/lib/src/srs_service.dart`](packages/core/lib/src/srs_service.dart:1) — SRS implementation (existing reference).
- New screens
  - [`packages/laxis_ui/lib/screens/review_queue_screen.dart`](packages/laxis_ui/lib/screens/review_queue_screen.dart:1) — Global Review Queue aggregating due cards across decks.
  - [`packages/laxis_ui/lib/screens/sentence_builder_play_screen.dart`](packages/laxis_ui/lib/screens/sentence_builder_play_screen.dart:1) — Deck-sourced Sentence Builder play screen with unlock logic.
- Learn Hub & navigation
  - [`packages/laxis_ui/lib/screens/learn_hub_screen.dart`](packages/laxis_ui/lib/screens/learn_hub_screen.dart:1) — Learn Hub UI: Quick Match, Review Queue, Sentence Builder buttons and deck SRS list.
  - [`packages/laxis_ui/lib/laxis_ui.dart`](packages/laxis_ui/lib/laxis_ui.dart:1) — exports updated to include new screens.
  - [`packages/laxis_ui/lib/screens/level_selection_screen_overhauled.dart`](packages/laxis_ui/lib/screens/level_selection_screen_overhauled.dart:1) — level card navigation changed to open Learn Hub.
- Minor UI wiring & reuse
  - [`packages/laxis_ui/lib/widgets/flashcard_widget.dart`](packages/laxis_ui/lib/widgets/flashcard_widget.dart:1) — existing flashcard widget used by reviewers.
  - [`lib/main.dart`](lib/main.dart:1) — app entry (no change to entrypoint).

What I changed (concise)
- DeckService.saveDeck now calls SrsService.ensureCardExists for every DeckCard so newly imported decks are registered into the SRS index automatically.
- Added ReviewQueueScreen that finds due card IDs via SrsService.getDueCardIds and builds the review queue from all saved decks.
- Added SentenceBuilderPlayScreen: uses a Deck as the source of the correct solution and card pool; implements a simple unlock rule:
  - A deck is unlocked for Sentence Builder when at least min(3, deckSize) cards meet a basic proficiency (repetitions >= 2 OR eFactor > 1.4). If locked, the screen suggests practicing Flashcards.
  - On correct solution, the screen records reviews for the solution card IDs in SRS.
- Learn Hub: made level cards open the Learn Hub; Learn Hub exposes Quick Match, Review Queue and Sentence Builder.
- Small safety fixes: removed usage of non-existent DeckCard.hasConjugation (defaulted to false where needed), ensured AnimationControllers already contained dispose() where previously audited.

How to run and manually verify (recommended)
1. Run app:
   - flutter run (select device) or run from IDE.
2. Steps in-app:
   - Home -> select a level (e.g., A1) -> Learn Hub
   - From Learn Hub:
     - Play Quick Match (micro-game)
     - Open Review Queue — shows due cards from all decks
     - Open Sentence Builder — if locked, follow the "Practice Flashcards" button to mark cards as reviewed; once proficiency threshold met, Sentence Builder unlocks
3. To run analysis & tests locally:
   - flutter analyze && flutter test
   - Note: some repo test files have pre-existing issues; run tests locally and share errors if you want fixes.

Known issues / caveats
- Analyzer/test warnings surfaced after edits (notably in some package tests like `packages/gamification_core/test/gamification_service_test.dart`). These resemble existing repo test/design issues; recommend running analysis/tests and sharing failures to fix them.
- The UI animation lifecycle audit is incomplete — 38 animation controller usages were discovered; 5 files were inspected and looked correct. Remaining files still need review for didUpdateWidget/dispose robustness.
- Some DeckCard fields are minimal by design; language-module-specific fields (e.g., hasConjugation) are mapped conservatively to avoid breaking changes.
- No unit tests were added for new screens / SRS integration in this pass — recommended next step.

Files to review in the PR (quick checklist)
- Deck + SRS: [`packages/core/lib/src/deck_service.dart`](packages/core/lib/src/deck_service.dart:1), [`packages/core/lib/src/srs_service.dart`](packages/core/lib/src/srs_service.dart:1)
- Learn Hub & navigation: [`packages/laxis_ui/lib/screens/learn_hub_screen.dart`](packages/laxis_ui/lib/screens/learn_hub_screen.dart:1), [`packages/laxis_ui/lib/screens/level_selection_screen_overhauled.dart`](packages/laxis_ui/lib/screens/level_selection_screen_overhauled.dart:1)
- New flows: [`packages/laxis_ui/lib/screens/review_queue_screen.dart`](packages/laxis_ui/lib/screens/review_queue_screen.dart:1), [`packages/laxis_ui/lib/screens/sentence_builder_play_screen.dart`](packages/laxis_ui/lib/screens/sentence_builder_play_screen.dart:1)
- Quick sanity check: [`packages/laxis_ui/lib/screens/flashcard_review_screen.dart`](packages/laxis_ui/lib/screens/flashcard_review_screen.dart:1)

Testing checklist to include in PR description
- [ ] App builds and starts on device/emulator
- [ ] Level card opens Learn Hub
- [ ] Quick Match launches and runs a short session
- [ ] Review Queue lists due cards (after seeding SRS via imports/practice)
- [ ] Sentence Builder locks until proficiency satisfied; unlocks after practicing via Flashcards
- [ ] No runtime exceptions during navigation between screens

Next recommended steps (priority)
1. Run static analysis and tests; fix repo test failures.
2. Complete animation controller lifecycle audit across remaining files.
3. Add unit/integration tests for:
   - Deck import/save -> SRS registration
   - ReviewQueue behavior
   - Sentence Builder unlock & correct flow
4. Consider migrating SRS/storage from SharedPreferences to a proper local DB (Isar/Hive) for reliability/migrations.
